# TheoDORE_py3
Port of TheoDORE (http://theodore-qc.sourceforge.net/) to Python3

Except for this README, all other documents were taken from the original repository on SourceForge.

Use the setup scripts with the default folder layout, or use the `flattened` folder where the directory layout is flattened. Simply `cd` into the flattened directory to use these scripts. When using the flattened directory, no setup is needed.

Mandatory Dependencies: numpy

Optional Dependencies: pylab, matplotlib, openbabel?

## TODO:

- [ ] Compile the bin folder into executables and create releases
- [ ] Copy SourceForge wiki to Github?
- [ ] Check if openbabel is now called babel, fix accordingly
- [ ] Review files and fix errors created by the `2to3` fixer
