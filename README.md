# TheoDORE_py3

**Update: Felix Plasser has informed me that the original Sourceforge repo is now updated to support Python 3, so this repo has been archived.**

**NOTE: I am in no way affiliated with Felix Plasser, the original creator of TheoDORE. Please see the sourceforge link if you want to contact him.**

Port of TheoDORE (http://theodore-qc.sourceforge.net/) to Python3

Except for this README, all other documents were taken from the original repository on SourceForge.

Use the setup scripts with the default folder layout, or use the `flattened` folder where the directory layout is flattened. Simply `cd` into the flattened directory to use these scripts. When using the flattened directory, no setup is needed.

Mandatory Dependencies: numpy

Optional Dependencies: pylab, matplotlib, openbabel?

## TODO:

- [ ] Compile the bin folder into executables and create releases
- [ ] Copy SourceForge wiki to Github?
- [ ] Check if openbabel is now called babel, fix accordingly
- [ ] Remove `readline` dependency in input_options.py
- [ ] Review files and fix errors created by the `2to3` fixer
